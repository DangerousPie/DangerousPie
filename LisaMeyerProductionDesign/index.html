            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Born somewhere between a shadow and a soft breeze, I began creating art shortly
                after misplacing a spoon and deciding it was a metaphor.
            </p>
            <p>
                My work explores the space between thought and toast — the crackling silence of
                unspoken subtitles, the geometry of dreams that smell faintly of printer ink.
            </p>
            <p>
                Educated in the School of Accidental Balance and Lightly Roasted Theories,
                I believe every medium has a spirit, except maybe PowerPoint.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time, I train clouds to dance in sync and archive emotional shadows
                cast by forgotten shopping lists.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is not a statement. It’s a soft launch into organized confusion.
